## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it add a new script or library

We favor scripts written in the Typescript language.

If you are adding your own version of a script a suggest creating a new directory inside the `src/scripts/` folder. Example: `src/scripts/edusig/my-awesome-script.ts`

If you are adding a new library script make sure it is reusable and not something you will need for a specific script.

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- It reads well
- Has a good score on [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

- To provide a collection of scripts for the BitBurner game and a server to download the scripts from.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant
